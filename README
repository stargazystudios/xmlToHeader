xmlToHeader.pl README

Please see the inline comments for a detailed explanation of the logic.

The script parses a given XSD file, and an accompanying, conforming XML file. If any 
processor instructions are found in the XSD file, then XML elements of the types flagged 
are used to create an enumeration block in a C header file for each type.

The purpose of this is to allow the design of data in an object-oriented manner (XML), but
 then to store the static data in a data-oriented manner at run-time (C). The linkage is 
 maintained through the naming of XML elements, and enumeration variables. At run-time, 
 variable names can be used to access data structures indexed by the enumerations (e.g. an
  array).
